3. Set Up the Frontend
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend folder:
bash
Wrap
Copy
cd frontend
Install the frontend dependencies:
bash
Wrap
Copy
npm install
Start the React development server:
bash
Wrap
Copy
npm start
The frontend should launch in your browser (e.g., at http://localhost:3000).
4. Verify Everything Works
Ensure the backend is running in one terminal (from the backend folder).
Ensure the frontend is running in another terminal (from the frontend folder).
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.
The frontend should communicate with the backend, which in turn connects to your PostgreSQL database.
Project Structure
backend: Contains the Node.js server, API routes, and database logic.
frontend: Contains the React app with the user interface.
Notes
Database: You’ll need to set up your own PostgreSQL database and update the credentials in the backend configuration. The app won’t work without this step!
Ports: By default, the frontend runs on 3000 and the backend on 5000. Adjust these in the respective config files if needed.
