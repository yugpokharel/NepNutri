####NepNutri - Nutritionist App
Welcome to NepNutri, a nutritionist application built with a React frontend and a Node.js backend, connected to a PostgreSQL database. This app is designed to help users manage nutrition-related tasks with an intuitive interface and a robust backend.

This repository contains two main folders:

frontend: The React-based user interface.
backend: The Node.js server handling API requests and database interactions.
Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project locally after cloning the repository.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
npm (comes with Node.js)
PostgreSQL (installed locally or via pgAdmin)
pgAdmin (optional, for managing your PostgreSQL database)

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/yugpokharel/NepNutri.git
cd NepNutri

2. Set Up the Backend
Navigate to the backend folder:

cd backend

3.Install the backend dependencies:
npm install

4Configure the PostgreSQL Database:
.Open pgAdmin (or your preferred PostgreSQL tool) and create a new database (e.g., nepnutri_db).
.Update the database configuration in the backend (likely in a file like config.js or .env). For example:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=nepnutri_db
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

Replace your_username and your_password with your PostgreSQL credentials.

4.Run the backend server:
npx nodemon index.js
The backend should now be running (e.g., on http://localhost:5000).

3. Set Up the Frontend
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend folder:
bash
Wrap
Copy
cd frontend
Install the frontend dependencies:
bash
Wrap
Copy
npm install
Start the React development server:
bash
Wrap
Copy
npm start
The frontend should launch in your browser (e.g., at http://localhost:3000).
4. Verify Everything Works
Ensure the backend is running in one terminal (from the backend folder).
Ensure the frontend is running in another terminal (from the frontend folder).
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.
The frontend should communicate with the backend, which in turn connects to your PostgreSQL database.
Project Structure
backend: Contains the Node.js server, API routes, and database logic.
frontend: Contains the React app with the user interface.
Notes
Database: You’ll need to set up your own PostgreSQL database and update the credentials in the backend configuration. The app won’t work without this step!
Ports: By default, the frontend runs on 3000 and the backend on 5000. Adjust these in the respective config files if needed.
